# Classification-of-flower-Images

This project explores multi-class classification of 5 different flower species (tulip, dandelion, daisy, rose, sunflower) using:
* pure densely connected neural networks (see [paper 1](https://github.com/fujavica/Classification-of-flower-Images/blob/main/Machine_Learning__Project_1.pdf))
* CNN (see [paper 2](https://github.com/fujavica/Classification-of-flower-Images/blob/main/Machine_Learning__Project_2.pdf))
